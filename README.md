Features

The system allows users to browse and purchase different items from different categories

The user has access to view all the products as a guest (no account).

In order for the user to add items to the cart, it's obligatory to register.

If the user used wrong password or username 3 times he has to wait for 15 minutes then try again.

The user can be both a customer and a seller, the registration form includes two selections (user and seller)

As a customer, each user has a cart and wishlist to add his favorite products for later.

The customer first creates an account (constraints are applied) then logs in to the website.

In case of forgetting the password, resetting the password is allowed. 

The user is directed to a form for resetting the password and an email confirmation is sent.

The system uses two-factor authentication (2FA) for user verification , a higher level of security than authentication methods that depend on single-factor authentication (SFA).

The system is managed by the admin.

The admin has his own dashboard aside from the website (doesn't show to the users).

Multiple admins are allowed.

The admin has the authority to add, update and delete products and categories (CRUD) as well as delete user or edit his role.
